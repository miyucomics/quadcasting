## Quadcasting
I am **thrilled** to announce the next evolution of Hexcasting: **Quadcasting**!

You see, Minecraft is a game of **squares**, yet weâ€™ve been stuck using these *insidious* hexagons this whole time. No longer! Quadcasting fixes this injustice using *advanced mathematics* with the help of the [Hexagon Bible](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/), restoring balance to our blocky universe.

Did you know, zero warcrimes have been committed with Quadcasting as of writing? Make the right choice.
